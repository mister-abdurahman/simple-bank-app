# simple-bank-app
A simple bank application that mimicks your regular bank app.

Tools used for this application: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, DOM MANIPULATION.

This app allows you to log in with a dummy account, make deposits, withdrawala, take loans, make transfers and they all reflect on the total balance of the account.

Dummy accounts you can use to login and make transactions with are: 

[js: 1111, jd: 2222, stw: 3333, ss: 4444]

Note that "js"is a username and "1111" is its password and same applies with the rest.

Have fun playing around the application.
